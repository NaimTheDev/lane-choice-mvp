# Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy your Flutter web app to Firebase Hosting.

## Prerequisites

1. **Firebase CLI installed:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Logged into Firebase:**
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Firebase project initialized** (already done)

## Deployment Scripts

We have two deployment scripts:

### 1. Full Deploy (`./deploy.sh`)

Use this for the first deployment or when you've made significant changes:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**What it does:**
- ‚ú® Cleans previous build
- üì¶ Updates dependencies
- üî® Builds Flutter web app (production mode)
- üöÄ Deploys to Firebase Hosting

**Estimated time:** 2-3 minutes

---

### 2. Quick Deploy (`./quick-deploy.sh`)

Use this for quick updates when you haven't changed dependencies:

```bash
./quick-deploy.sh
```

**What it does:**
- üî® Builds Flutter web app (production mode)
- üöÄ Deploys to Firebase Hosting

**Estimated time:** 30-60 seconds

---

## Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Build
flutter build web --release

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

---

## Your App URLs

After deployment, your app will be available at:

- **Primary:** https://lane-choice-mvp-backend.web.app
- **Secondary:** https://lane-choice-mvp-backend.firebaseapp.com

## Deploy Other Firebase Services

### Deploy Firestore Rules:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### Deploy Cloud Functions:
```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Deploy Everything:
```bash
flutter build web --release
firebase deploy
```

## Troubleshooting

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before your first deployment:**
